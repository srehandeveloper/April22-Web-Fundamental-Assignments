<h1>JS</h1>
<p>What is JS</p>
<p>JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web,
     alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,
      often incorporating third-party libraries.</p>
      <p>js makes responsive design easier.
           JavaScript has become integral to the Internet experience as developers build increased interaction and complexity into their applications. 
           Search engines, ecommerce, content management systems, responsive design, social media and phone apps would not be possible without it.</p>
           <p>Why JavaScript is the best language?
            JavaScript is the better choice for desktop and mobile websites.
             Between JQuery, Angular, and React, JavaScript provides virtually endless capabilities for web programming.
              When a business or individual hires a programmer for a project, 
              having an experienced developer is the key to a successful project.
           </p>
              <p> Client-side JavaScript is very fast because it can be run immediately within the client-side browser.
                Unless outside resources are required, JavaScript is unhindered by network calls to a backend server.
                 Simplicity. JavaScript is relatively simple to learn and implement.</p>
